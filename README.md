# 2023 - Venmurasu Programming Team Qualifier Contest

## Objective

The objective of this contest is to qualify the teams for VPT Programming Contest

The task focuses on builing a simple web application using external API using a programming language(s) of their choice.

## Pre-requisites

1. Basic knowledge on how to use Git and GitHub.
2. A public GitHub repository to upload code and data.

## Task 

Create a web application to search books using API from [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org) using a programming language of your choice.
The total duration will be 12hrs (8:00am - 8:00pm).

OpenLibrary offers suite of [APIs](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to access Book related information. Use the API to build a simple Book search application. The applicable APIs for this functionality:
* [Books](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books) API - Retrieve a specific work or edition by identifier
* [Search](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search) API - Search results for books, authors, and more

A sample search page is shown below. Your application need not use the same design but should have similar functionality. Like provide a keyword to search, display results, click on a search result to show more details, pagination.
